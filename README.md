### Honeymath Platforms
Honeymath is an online platform aimed at enhancing mathematics education through interactive problem-solving and assignment management. It features cross-platform compatibility, uses Python for creating platform-independent problems, and offers an interactive learning environment with instant feedback. It also supports comprehensive assignment management with automatic grading and role-based access for students, TAs, and instructors. For more information, visit [honeymath.com](https://honeymath.com).

Website(API) [https://logicguide.api](https://logicguide.api)

This is a potential solution for AI reasoning.

**LogicGuide** empowers users to create structured logic maps by guiding AI through targeted questioning. This API helps Large Language Models (LLMs) break down complex problems and generate organized insights through a series of tailored questions.

## ðŸ’ª My backgrounds

As a math Ph.D and an assistant professor working at university. I have solid math background. At the same time I am a fan of coding. Take a look at my math papers available at [http://qirui.li](http://qirui.li)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

I am interested in this project [Mr Randeer](https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor), where the prompt is in code-format, making GPT scriptable!
