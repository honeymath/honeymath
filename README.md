Projects and Ideas.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

### Honeymath Platforms
Honeymath is an online platform aimed at enhancing mathematics education through interactive problem-solving and assignment management. It features cross-platform compatibility, uses Python for creating platform-independent problems, and offers an interactive learning environment with instant feedback. It also supports comprehensive assignment management with automatic grading and role-based access for students, TAs, and instructors. For more information, visit [honeymath.com](https://honeymath.com).

> [Honeymath Platform](https://github.com/honeymath/honeyplatform) This is a platform generating math exercises. The website is available at https://honeymath.com
> I have used this platform during pandemic for teaching

### osfor.ai

Osfor.ai https://osfor.ai is a computer for AI. The goal is to smoothen the process for AI to control everything in our life. Hopefully it could be applied to many situations.

<!-- Project in 2024 currently stopped.
This is a potential solution for AI reasoning:

**LogicGuide** empowers users to create structured logic maps by guiding AI through targeted questioning. This API helps Large Language Models (LLMs) break down complex problems and generate organized insights through a series of tailored questions. It is similar to the teacher guide students to finish a difficult question by adding step-by-step subquestions.

## 💪 My backgrounds

As a math Ph.D and an assistant professor working at a university. I have solid math background. At the same time I am a fan of coding. Take a look at my math papers available at [http://qirui.li](http://qirui.li)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning...

I am interested in building an AI agent and workflow automation. I am building APIs to equipped my GPTs with arms and legs. Although Apple Intellegence is coming, I think being able to build these on my own would give me more flexibility.

I am interested in building projects with [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen).

I am trying to use Dia and test the ability of AI when co-browsing websites.


## 🤖 My understanding of the future world

The Artificial Intellegence has been developed for 70 years. From the emerging of the first usable language model, we are experiencing some dramatic change within the next 50 years. It is for everyone, and they should all learn the new way to work.

- Current challenge of AI:  Energy supply; Limit of calculating ability.

- Current trending of AI: miniturization; localization; AI-agent; 

- Current problems of AI: Interpretability; Safty

#### Technological singularity
Wrote at year 2024:
> If AI reaches human intelligence, humans will have created an object as smart as themselves. AI will then be able to do anything humans can.

> Humans create human-level AI, which can create AI-level AII, which can create AII-level AIII, and so on.  This infinite chain of equal-intelligence-objects is mathematically a singularity.

> After this point, AI's intelligence will surpass humans, AII will surpass AI, AIII will surpass AII, and so on. The only limitation is energy. All enegies will be consumed and transformed into technology. ASI will become soon after AGI.

> So, be prepared.

Wrote at year 2025:

> AI is not human. It processes the world in text and structure, while humans navigate it through images and intuition. The future will demand applications designed not only for human needs but also for AI’s mode of operation.

> AI evolves on a separate track. Its growth does not erase human work but reshapes it. The myth of “no jobs left” is false — instead, people face more tasks, more focus, and higher pressure to adapt.

> Technology becomes power. Capitalism and governance will be increasingly driven by technical systems. Old regional conflicts may fade, only to be replaced by ruthless struggles waged through AI. Economic gains will concentrate, amplifying inequality.

> AI solves, but also destabilizes. Each precise solution breeds a larger problem. As humans outsource thought to machines, hallucinations spread, common agreements fracture, and society risks losing its shared reality.

> Dependency corrodes the mind. Addiction to AI and the virtual world accelerates skill decay and weakens independent judgment. A civilization that abandons its own thinking may find itself ruled by the very tools it created.
