### Honeymath Platforms
Honeymath is an online platform aimed at enhancing mathematics education through interactive problem-solving and assignment management. It features cross-platform compatibility, uses Python for creating platform-independent problems, and offers an interactive learning environment with instant feedback. It also supports comprehensive assignment management with automatic grading and role-based access for students, TAs, and instructors. For more information, visit [honeymath.com](https://honeymath.com).

> [Honeymath Platform](https://github.com/honeymath/honeyplatform) This is a platform generating math exercises. The website is available at https://honeymath.com
> I have used this platform during pandemic for teaching



This is a potential solution for AI reasoning:

**LogicGuide** empowers users to create structured logic maps by guiding AI through targeted questioning. This API helps Large Language Models (LLMs) break down complex problems and generate organized insights through a series of tailored questions. It is similar to the teacher guide students to finish a difficult question by adding step-by-step subquestions.

## ðŸ’ª My backgrounds

As a math Ph.D and an assistant professor working at a university. I have solid math background. At the same time I am a fan of coding. Take a look at my math papers available at [http://qirui.li](http://qirui.li)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

I am interested in building an AI agent and workflow automation. I am building APIs to equipped my GPTs with arms and legs. Although Apple Intellegence is coming, I think being able to build these on my own would give me more flexibility. 

I am interested in building projects with [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen).


## The future about AI, AGI, and ASI

- Current challenge of AI:  Energy supply; Limit of calculating ability.

- Current trending of AI: miniturization; localization; AI-agent; 

- Current problems of AI: Interpretability; Safty

#### Technological singularity

If AI reaches human intelligence, humans will have created an object as smart as themselves. AI will then be able to do anything humans can.

Humans create human-level AI, which can create AII, which can create AIII, and so on. This infinite chain is mathematically a singularity.

After this point, AI's intelligence will surpass humans, AII will surpass AI, AIII will surpass AII, and so on. The only limitation is energy.

So, be prepared.
